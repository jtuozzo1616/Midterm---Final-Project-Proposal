# 🎥 Final Project Demonstration Video  
**Course:** ITAI 1378 – Computer Vision & AI  
**Student:** José Tuozzo  
**Project:** Waste Classification Using Computer Vision  
**Project Tier:** Tier 1 — Image Classification  

---

## 🎬 Overview

This video demonstrates the complete functionality of the **Waste Classification AI System**, including:

- The model architecture (EfficientNet-B0)
- Dataset preprocessing
- Real inference on new images
- Grad-CAM heatmaps for interpretability
- System workflow inside Google Colab

The demo follows the official requirements in the **Final Project Guide**, which states that the submission must include a *demonstration video showing the system working*.

## 📌 What the Video Shows

### 🔹 1. Notebook Structure
A walkthrough of the main notebook (`01_data_exploration.ipynb`), highlighting:
- Project description
- Dataset setup
- Model definition
- Training pipeline

### 🔹 2. Loading the Model
The video shows the section where EfficientNet-B0 is loaded and fine-tuned.

### 🔹 3. Preprocessing & Transformations
Includes:
- Resize  
- Normalize  
- Data augmentation  

### 🔹 4. Real-Time Prediction
The system receives an uploaded image and outputs:
- Predicted class  
- Confidence score  

### 🔹 5. Grad-CAM Visualization
A heatmap overlay shows where the model focuses to make the prediction.

### 🔹 6. Second Example (Consistency Test)
An optional second image is tested to demonstrate prediction stability.

## 🧠 Why This Video Matters

The demonstration confirms:

- The model works correctly  
- It performs inference on unseen images  
- It provides visual explanations (Grad-CAM)  
- The system can be used in real applications  

This fulfills the **35% Final Project requirement** for an in-class demonstration.

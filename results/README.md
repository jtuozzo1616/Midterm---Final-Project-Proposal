## Description

- **Loss / Accuracy Curves**  
  Show how the model improves over time and whether training is stable.

- **Confusion Matrix**  
  Highlights which classes are commonly misclassified.

- **Grad-CAM Visualizations**  
  Provide insight into what the model is focusing on when making predictions.

## How to Reproduce the Plots

All plots can be generated by running:

```python
plt.savefig("results/loss_curve.png", dpi=300)

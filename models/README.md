# Models Folder

This folder stores the model artifacts used in this project.

## Contents

- **Pretrained models** — Optional: downloaded backbones or feature extractors  
- **Trained models** — The final fine-tuned model (`best.pth`) obtained during training  
- **Documentation** — This README file explaining how to load and use the model

Because trained model files are often large, they may not be committed directly to GitHub.

If the final model cannot be uploaded, please include:

- A **Google Drive link**  
- Instructions on where to place `best.pth` so the demo notebook works

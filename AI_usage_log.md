# AI Usage Log — Waste Classification Final Project

## Tools Used
- ChatGPT (OpenAI)

## How AI Assisted the Project
AI tools were used to:
- Improve documentation quality across the repository
- Suggest folder structure and organizational best practices
- Rewrite or polish markdown sections for clarity and professionalism
- Support conceptual explanations (Grad-CAM, transfer learning, early stopping)
- Help design a strong README for the final project
- Provide guidance on aligning the repository with the Final Project Guide

## Work Completed Independently
The following were performed manually by the student:
- Dataset setup and directory organization
- Developing, modifying, and debugging the training code
- Running experiments and collecting evaluation metrics
- Implementing and interpreting Grad-CAM outputs
- Managing the GitHub repository and commit history
- Curating results and selecting meaningful visualizations

## Estimated Contribution
- **70–80%**: Student-generated code, experimentation, debugging, evaluation  
- **20–30%**: AI-assisted documentation, structure suggestions, and wording improvements  

## Reflection
AI was used as a support tool for explanations, formatting, and documentation.  
All technical code and model development were fully understood, tested, and implemented by the student.
